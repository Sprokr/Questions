#### HashMap Implementation
	- http://javahungry.blogspot.com/2013/08/hashing-how-hash-map-works-in-java-or.html
	- put (key,value) will return
		1.  null , if key is unique and added to the map
		2.  Old Value of the key , if key is duplicate
	- An instance of HashMap has two parameters that affect its performance: initial capacity and load factor. 
	- The hashmap implementation provides constant time performance for (get and put) basic operations i.e the complexity of get() and put() is O(1)
